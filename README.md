# Data Pipeline on Airflow-Mysql and DBT
A city traffic department wants to collect traffic data using swarm UAVs (drones) from a number of locations in the city and use the data collected for improving traffic flow in the city and for a number of other undisclosed projects. Your startup is responsible for creating a scalable data warehouse that will host the vehicle trajectory data extracted by analyzing footage taken by swarm drones and static roadside cameras.

Using a docker-compose file, developed a completely dockerized ELT pipeline with PostgreSQL for data storage, Airflow for automation and orchestration, DBT for data transformation, and a Redash dashboard connected to the PostgreSQL database.
